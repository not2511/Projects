# FoodVisionMini

FoodVisionMini is a deep learning-based food classification project that detects images of **Pizza, Sushi, and Steak** using **EfficientNet-B2** in PyTorch.

## Features
- Utilizes **EfficientNet-B2** for accurate food classification.
- Trained on a dataset containing **Pizza, Sushi, and Steak** images.
- Built with **PyTorch** for efficient model training and inference.
- Supports deployment as a web or mobile application for real-time classification.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python (>=3.8) is installed, along with the required dependencies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes labeled images for **Pizza, Sushi, and Steak** and can be customized or sourced from publicly available datasets.

## Model Training
- Preprocesses images (resize, normalize, augment) for training.
- Fine-tunes **EfficientNet-B2** using transfer learning.
- Optimized with **CrossEntropyLoss** and **Adam** optimizer.
- Evaluates model performance on validation and test sets.

## Inference
The trained model can classify new images into one of the three categories.

## Deployment
Supports deployment using **Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit** for web-based classification.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset for better model generalization.
- Experiment with alternative deep learning architectures.
- Deploy as a mobile application using **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX**.
